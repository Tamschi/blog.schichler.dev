If you're looking for a developer who

- is very **flexible regarding programming languages**,  
  (preferences: Rust, TypeScript; also: C#, modern C++, Kotlin, Java, ‚Ä¶)

- [great at robust CSS](https://github.com/Tamschi/CSS-Table-Tennis#readme)/SCSS and **loves hands-on GUI work**,  
  (preferences: working directly with designers, HTML or Angular, WPF/XAML;  
  interested in learning about unmanaged GUI programming)

- efficiently writes **[precise](https://docs.rs/lignin/latest/lignin/) and [expressive](https://docs.rs/serde_taml/0.0.3/serde_taml/de/type_overrides/index.html) documentation**,  
  and [can break down complex topics into clear explanations](https://blog.schichler.dev/pinning-in-plain-english-ckwdq3pd0065zwks10raohh85) (and can teach ad-hoc if needed),

- cares about **misuse-resistant API design**, opportunistic modularisation,  
  and also **efficiency in coding, compilation and at runtime**,

- loves software design puzzles and **will occasionally¬π come up with novel** algorithms, data structures, protocols, synchronisation primitives, file formats or potentially other **technical designs fine-tuned to your use-case**,  
  (¬π only when there's no existing solution or remix that fits well, unless asked to.)

- is relatively soft-spoken, easy to get along with, uses emoji a little bit more than average and **writes code with human readers in mind**,

then I may be a good fit for the position üë®‚Äçüíª

I'm looking for engaging and **challenging work** where I can **push the boundaries of my own understanding** and, ideally, of **user freedom and what is feasible to implement**. I'm quick on the uptake and have considerable transferable skills, so even in a new domain I should be good to go within a few weeks.

**Here are some ideas for roles or positions that I think I'd shine in as-is**:

- framework developer,
- tools developer (especially tools for creative work),
- research-adjacent work (as I have some background in physics and am familiar with scientific methods),
- development work that requires reading scientific papers or similar publications,
- complex graphical application development,
- high-performance or resource-constrained software

I **speak German natively**, am **fluent in English** (in speech and writing), **understand written and spoken French** (though I'm a bit too rusty at this point to correctly use it myself) and can read technical texts in Portuguese.

I'm a very fast reader and regularly skim the entire documentation of new technology I'm unfamiliar with, so that I can later look up specifics within seconds and **use the right tool or pattern as each situation demands**.

**Availability** (last updated: 2022-08-20)

- I plan to start my next job somewhere in **October through February**.
- I'm available in person in **Hamburg (Germany) or, also internationally, remote**, around **25 to 30 hours a week**.
  - I don't own and don't plan to purchase a car, so if your office has a good connection from Altona, then colour me interested üöâüöè
  - My schedule is flexible and **I can match your time zone** if necessary,  
    except for speaking on calls between 9PM and 7AM CE(S)T.
- I won't work in arms industry or private financial sector, or mobile gambling.  
  Health-care-related jobs are case-by-case, but **if the focus is on research then do let me know**, because that's a field I'm curious about!
