I recently set up containerised builds for [my website](https://schichler.dev/) [It's not quite ready yet.] and thought I'd share the configuration for others to use as reference.

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Note that I'm using Docker mainly to avoid installing tooling globally. If this isn't the case for you, then a different build strategy will likely be better.*

Additionally, some command lines will contain placeholders with example content `{EX:like this}` and optional segments `[OPT:like this]`. You will have to at least remove the respective parentheses and `EX:` or `OPT:` to make them work.

### .vscode/tasks.json

```json
{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format¬π
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Create {EX:target/bundle/schichler-dev}/",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "mkdir --parents {EX:target/bundle/schichler-dev}",
            "windows": {
                "command": "if not exist {EX:target/bundle/schichler-dev}/NUL mkdir {EX:target\\bundle\\schichler-dev}"
            }
        },
        {
            "label": "Build {EX:schichler-dev}",
            "dependsOn": [
                "Create {EX:target/bundle/schichler-dev}/"
            ],
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "docker build -t {EX:schichler-dev} -f {EX:schichler-dev/Dockerfile} {EX:.} && docker run [OPT:--read-only] --mount type=bind,source=${workspaceFolder}{EX:/target/bundle/schichler-dev},destination=/mnt/target --rm {EX:schichler-dev}",
            // The task group shown by Tasks: Run Build Task.
            "group": "build",
            "presentation": {
                // Automatically show the problems panel if any problems are matched.
                // The default here is "never".
                "revealProblems": "onProblem"
            },
            // Prevents Code's prompt whether to show output.
            // This was added automatically when I selected never to.
            // You can add problem matchers¬≤ to make Code recognise
            "problemMatcher": []
        }
    ]
}
```

This creates the following entry in the Tasks: Run Build Task command menu, by default bound to Ctrl + Shift + B:

...which runs the following shell commands in dependent sequence:
```sh
docker build -t {EX:schichler-dev} -f {EX:schichler-dev/Dockerfile} {EX:.}
docker run [OPT:--read-only] --mount type=bind,source=${workspaceFolder}{EX:/target},destination=/mnt/target --rm {EX:schichler-dev}
```

*In my case*:

1. [Make the directory (`mkdir`)](http://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mkdir.1.html) path (`--parents`) `target/bundle/schichler-dev`, if it doesn't exist yet (`--parents`).  
üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Windows requires special handling here, since Windows's [MKDIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/md) will error if the directory already exists, isn't configurable in that regard, and also doesn't support `/` as path separator.  
`CMD /E:ON /C` makes sure command extensions are on (default since 2000/XP) so we can create the entire path at once.  
`if not exist target/bundle/schichler-dev/NUL` makes sure `target/bundle/schichler-dev` doesn't exist **as a directory** already, by checking for the special file `NUL` within it.  
See <https://stackoverflow.com/a/4165472>.*

2.  1. [Build](http://manpages.org/docker-build) a Docker image and tag (`-t`) it as `schichler-dev`(`:latest`).  
Use the Docker file (`-f`) located at `schichler-dev/Dockerfile`¬≥ and use `.`‚Å¥ as context root.
  2. [Run](http://manpages.org/docker-run) the Docker image tagged `schichler-dev` with its internal file system read-only (`--read-only`)‚Åµ, while mounting (`--mount`) `${workspaceFolder}/target/bundle/schichler-dev`‚Å∂ mutably inside the container as `/mnt/target`. Remove (`--rm`) the container instance afterwards.

¬≥ You don't need to specify this for a `Dockerfile` in the context root.  
‚Å¥ The folder opened in Code is the working directory for the command.  
‚Åµ This isn't strictly necessary, but Docker may be able to start the container a little faster if it has a matching optimisation.  
‚Å∂ Full paths are required here.  
üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Code handily expands `${workspaceFolder}` to what we need. Show the suggestions (default: `Ctrl + Space`) within the `"command"` parameter's value (but only before the first such expansion, it seems) for a list of other values that can be interpolated.*

### Dockerfile

End your (Unix) Dockerfile with:
```Dockerfile
CMD rm -fr /mnt/target/* \
    && cp -vr --no-target-directory {EX:bundle} /mnt/target
```

This *in my case*:

1. [Removes (`rm`)](http://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rm.1.html), recursively (`-r`), all files and directories (`*`) inside the mounted host directory.

2. [Copies (`cp`)](http://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html), recursively (`-r`), the contents of (`--no-target-directory`) my build directory inside the container (`bundle`) into the mounted host directory visible at `/mnt/target` inside the container.  
üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Instead of writing `--no-target-directory`, you could append *`/*`* to the source directory to use shell expansion. I don't know whether this makes a practical difference.*

### Running the Task

You can now run the build task by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + B` and then `Enter`.

Code should show the output of the command in a new task terminal window.
