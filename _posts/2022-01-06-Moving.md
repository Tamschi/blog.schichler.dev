Hashnode unfortunately has been hard at work pushing their `web3` tag, as well as various blockchain and NFT hackathons.

For now I'm using [a fork](https://github.com/Tamschi/jekyll-theme-chirpy-custom) of [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#readme)ðŸ’Ž, but I'd like to eventually move to [Asteracea](https://github.com/Tamschi/Asteracea#readme)-based templating ðŸŒ¼ðŸ¦€.

I'll update this post with the changes I made to the theme to not break incoming links.
