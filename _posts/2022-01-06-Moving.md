Hashnode has been hard at work pushing their `web3` tag as well as various NFT hackathons. [This]() [is]() [completely]() [untenable]() [for]() [various]() [reasons](), which means I'm moving my blog to disassociate from that company as much as I can.

For now I'm using [a fork](https://github.com/Tamschi/jekyll-theme-chirpy-custom) of [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#readme)ðŸ’Ž, but I'd like to eventually move to [Asteracea](https://github.com/Tamschi/Asteracea#readme)-based templating ðŸŒ¼ðŸ¦€.

I'll update this post with the changes I made to the theme to not break incoming links.
