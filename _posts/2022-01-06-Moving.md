Hashnode unfortunately has been hard at work pushing their `web3` tag, as well as various blockchain and NFT hackathons.

For now I'm using [a fork](https://github.com/Tamschi/jekyll-theme-chirpy-custom) of [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#readme)ðŸ’Ž, but I'd like to eventually move to [Asteracea](https://github.com/Tamschi/Asteracea#readme)-based templating ðŸŒ¼ðŸ¦€.

I'll update this post with the changes I made to the theme to not break incoming links.

## Running the blog locally

While this blog is deployed automatically on GitHub Pages when I push a new revision to the `main` branch,
it's still much faster to run it locally to edit more-or-less live. (This is actually more convenient than on Hashnode,
as I can more easily see the markdown source and rendered page side by side.)

Run `bundle` to initialise the lockfile for your blog after running the init script as per the theme instructions. Additionally run `bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux` to make the lockfile compatible with the automatic deployment Action.
You should commit this lockfile to Git also, to make sure the site always builds reliably.

Afterwards, you can run a live-editable version of the site like this:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll s
```

It will tell you the local address to open.

It can take a moment for file updates to be reflected, even after "...done" first appears.
If you don't see your changes, refresh the page again or set up automatic refresh in your browser.

### Updating dependencies

Apparently you can do this by running:

```sh
bundle update
```

## Porting posts

Posts seem to only appear if their file name follows the `YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md` schema, so to start porting,
you can simply drop the `*.md` files from your Hashnode Git backup into the `_posts/` folder in your blog repository root.

### Post metadata and redirects

I mostly followed [these instructions](http://www.marran.com/tech/creating-redirects-with-jekyll/)
to set up redirects, with some small adjustments to instead show a message within the normal site layout and redirect only after a short delay.

This means I only need to update the start of each markdown file as follows:

```md
## Building non-containers with Docker and VS Code

<!-- â€¦ -->
```
{: file="ck74szgf807g9d9s1s6o88c8f.md (from Hashnode backup repository)"}

```md

title: Building non-containers with Docker and VS Code
date: 2020-02-27 14:48:00 +0100
categories: [Build Automation]
tags: [VS Code, Docker]
redirects:
  # current Hashnode URL scheme
  - /building-non-containers-with-docker-and-vs-code
  # legacy URL, only necessary if your post existed before you switched it over
  - /building-non-containers-with-docker-and-vs-code-ck74szgf807g9d9s1s6o88c8f
---

<!-- â€¦ -->
```
{: file="_posts/2020-02-27-Building non containers with Docker and VS Code.md"}

You can find the precise publication time of Hashnode posts by hovering over time date here: ![Tamme Schichler Published on Feb 27, 2020 (<- pointing at this), with a tooltip that reads "Feb 27, 2020 14:48".](/assets/img/posts/2022-01-06-Moving/Hashnode post timestamp tooltip.png)

I guessed `+0100` for the time zone, since that was mine at that time. This could be wrong.

### Rehosting images

You will have to rehost your images currently stored on the Hashnode CDN.

They currently still work even if you keep the old URL (before shutting down your Hashnode blog entirely, at least), but that may change in the future.
It's definitely better to make a local copy in general, too, since they aren't included in the automatic backup archive.

> Side-note:
>
> **If you use images or other non-text files with a file extension other than `.png`, `.jpg` or `.ico`, make sure to adjust the `.gitattributes` file *first*!**  
> If you don't do this, other image files may break in a way that's very difficult to recover from.

There doesn't really seem to be a specific place to put them, so I just created a folder at `/assets/img/posts/<same name as the md file>/` and dropped them in there. You can them update the post's markdown as follows:

```diff
- ![Code_JVjZIdealV.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1582800675358/UHG9unECP8.png)  
+ ![[Select the build task to run] > Build schichler-dev](/assets/img/posts/2020-02-27-Building non containers with Docker and VS Code/run task Build schichler-dev.png)
```
{: file="_posts/2020-02-27-Building non containers with Docker and VS Code.md (diff excerpt)"}

(I chose to also update the image's alt text, within the leading `![â€¦]`, to better support readers using screen reader software.)

There's a context menu entry to copy the relative path of a(n image) file in Code's file picker.  
Make sure to prepend `/` if you are using the same theme as me, and to replace `\` with `/` on Windows.

### Markdown adjustment

The markdown parser on Hashnode is non-standard (as far as a standard exists at all for markdown in practice), so parts of your post may render in unexpected way.

For example, I had to made the following adjustment:

```diff
  > In this post:
+ >
  > - example configuration
  > - command line breakdowns
  > - links to relevant documentation
+
  - - -
```

Adding the newline between the title and list wasn't strictly necessary, but fixed a warning given by [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint).

Adding a line between the end of the quote block and the divider *was* necessary.

### Mentions

Hashnode allows mentions like this:

```md
@[Display Name](@handle)
```
{: file="Markdown (Hashnode)"}

You can find all instances of this by searching globally for `](@`.

I had used only three mentions in the blog texts proper, so I replaced their target with the full URL manually instead of writing a plugin.

### Embeds

The following syntax shows a preview card on Hashnode, but is non-standard and breaks in the move:

```md
%[https://blog.schichler.dev/intrusive-smart-pointers-heap-only-types-ckvzj2thw0caoz2s1gpmi1xm8]
```
{: file="2021-11-24-Pinning in plain English.md (Hashnode)"}

I tried to bodge a plugin for this, but failed.  
(I don't know nearly enough efficiently Ruby to figure out how requiring `link_preview` breaks things elsewhere, and `link_preview_generator` depends on conflicting `nokogiri` which means `bundler` gets stuck on Windows.)

For now the plugin just outputs warnings like this:

```text
Warning: Replacing rich preview `%[https://blog.schichler.dev/intrusive-smart-pointers-heap-only-types-ckvzj2thw0caoz2s1gpmi1xm8]` in C:/Users/Tamme/Documents/Projekte/blog.schichler.dev/_posts/2021-11-24-Pinning in plain English.md with plain link `<https://blog.schichler.dev/intrusive-smart-pointers-heap-only-types-ckvzj2thw0caoz2s1gpmi1xm8>`.
```
{: file="stderr"}

Replace the embed with a proper link to fix it.

### Heading links

Headings' `id=`s are prefixed with `heading-` on hashnode but not in this blog theme.

You can quickly globally find-and-replace `#heading-` with `#`, as long as the former doesn't appear in your posts' text.

<!--TODO: Note to self: Set canonical URLs in Hashnode after I'm done and the new blog is live, then mention that here. -->
<!-- TODO: Emit RSS at /rss.xml, and surface that. -->
